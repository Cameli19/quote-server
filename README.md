# Axum Database-Driven Web Service

## What I Did

- Built a Rust web service using **Axum** with database integration.
- Created server-rendered HTML UI with **Askama**.
- Documented the REST API using **Utoipa**, exposing Swagger-UI.
- Developed a simple REST client UI in **Yew** (WASM frontend).
- Connected everything to a SQLite database.

---

## What Did Not Go Well / Outstanding

- WASM frontend UI is minimal and could be improved.
- Some API endpoints lack full error handling.
- Tests are limited.

---

## Additional Notes:

- Server runs at `http://localhost:8080`.
- Plan to add authentication and improve frontend.
