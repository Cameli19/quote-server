# quote-server

**Author:** Camellia Tran

## Overview

This is a simple web application built with Rust using the [Axum](https://docs.rs/axum/latest/axum/) framework for routing and [Askama](https://docs.rs/askama/latest/askama/) for server-side templating. The server delivers classic and famous quotes to users through a stylized webpage.

When users visit the homepage, they are presented with a single quote and its author in a structured, styled format. The application is designed to be easily extended with more quotes and features, and serves as a foundational exercise in building dynamic web apps with Rust.

## Features

- Serves a single quote using a structured HTML template
- CSS styling for quote presentation
- Clean and simple layout
- Modular and extensible design
